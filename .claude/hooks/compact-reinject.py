"""SessionStart hook: re-inject context after compaction.

PROBLEM: Generic reminders ("don't forget X") are useless after compaction
because they don't tell Claude WHAT it was doing. The real loss is task state.

APPROACH: Two-tier context restoration:
1. STATIC reminders — critical rules Claude gets wrong without them
2. DYNAMIC state — read precompact-state.json (written by PreCompact hook)
   to restore ACTUAL work context: which files were being edited, what kind
   of work was happening, which agents were spawned.

The PreCompact hook saves this data BEFORE compaction destroys context.
This hook reads it back AFTER, giving Claude real continuity instead of
just generic rules.

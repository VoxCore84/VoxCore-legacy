# Headless Build Validation Architecture

## 1) Goal & Scope
The main goal is to develop a headless build validation system that allows for CLI-driven building processes within the VoxCore project. This includes standardizing build scripts, defining retry policies, logging build outputs, and introducing error parsing for automated correction. Any graphical user interface adjustments or IDE-specific modifications are out of scope.

## 2) Problem Statement
Currently, the build processes for VoxCore are fragmented, with mixed Visual Studio versions and hardcoded paths leading to potential configuration drift and inefficiencies in headless environments. A unified and automated approach to build validation is needed to ensure consistency and facilitate easy integration with AI-based correction systems.

## 3) Architectural Decisions
### 3.1 Unified Build Script
A single entry script simplifies build execution across different environments and ensures all necessary environment setups are consistent.

**Approved Behavior:**
Implementation of a unified `tools/build.py` that abstracts environment setup and build execution.

**Disallowed Behavior:**
Hardcoding environment paths or using multiple scripts for setting up and running the builds.

### 3.2 Logging and Error Parsing
Capturing build logs and parsing errors centrally allows for better integration with AI correction engines and improved debugging processes.

**Approved Behavior:**
All build outputs should be redirected to `logs/build/latest_build_log.txt` with error outputs being parsed to `AI_Studio/3_Audits/latest_compile_errors.md`.

**Disallowed Behavior:**
Directly reading Ninja outputs from terminal for error corrections.

### 3.3 Retry and Exit Policies
To avoid infinite loops and resource wastage, a strict policy on build retries and exit based on pre-defined criteria should be enforced.

**Approved Behavior:**
The build system should halt after 5 consecutive failures or any 2 identical failures, ensuring stability and pre-emptive recognition of build issues.

**Disallowed Behavior:**
Continuing builds past the set retry limits without intervention.

### 3.4 Environment Standardization
To mitigate the risk of configuration drift and hardcoded dependencies, all builds must be initiated with environment setups that respect path logic dynamically.

**Approved Behavior:**
All build environment variables and dependencies should be invoked via dynamic path mechanisms within `tools/build.py`.

**Disallowed Behavior:**
Use of raw shell `cd` commands or absolute paths within scripts for environment setup.

## 4) File Structure
```text
```
VoxCore/
├── tools/
│   ├── build.py
│   ├── shortcuts/
│   │   └── build_scripts_rel.bat (updated to reference build.py)
│   └── logs/
│       ├── build/
│       │   └── latest_build_log.txt
│       └── latest_compile_errors.md
```
```

## 5) Logic & Data Flow
1. The `tools/build.py` script is called from the CLI.
2. It sets up the build environment using dynamic path logic and invokes the Ninja generator.
3. The build output and logs are captured and written to `logs/build/latest_build_log.txt`.
4. On completion, the log file is parsed, and compile warnings/errors are documented in `AI_Studio/3_Audits/latest_compile_errors.md`.
5. The system stops if 5 consecutive failures occur, or 2 identical errors are seen, recording these in the log for diagnostics.

## 6) Constraints for Implementation
- Use Ninja as the exclusive build generator.
- No modifications to GUI or IDE settings are allowed.
- No daemonization of multi-provider APIs in this functionality.
- Stick to Python for scripting the unified build launcher.

## 7) Acceptance Criteria
- `tools/build.py` executes and completes builds as specified.
- Logs are correctly written and are comprehensive for error extraction.
- Retry and exit criteria are respected during build executions.
- Error summaries are correctly generated in Markdown format for AI processing.

## 8) Recommended Implementation Order
### Phase 1: Script Development
- Develop `tools/build.py` to setup environment and invoke build.
- Update existing scripts to reference `build.py`.

### Phase 2: Logging Integration
- Redirect Ninja output to `logs/build/latest_build_log.txt`.
- Parse log files and output errors to `AI_Studio/Reports/Audits/latest_compile_errors.md`.

### Phase 3: Retry Logic Implementation
- Enforce build retry and exit conditions in `build.py`.

### Phase 4: Validation and Debugging
- Test build script in different environments.
- Verify log accuracy and error parsing correctness.
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met.

## 9) Immediate Next Actions
- Start developing the `tools/build.py` script to establish a reference point for all further architectural elements.
- Modify `tools/shortcuts/build_scripts_rel.bat` to rely on `build.py` for execution.
- Conduct a preliminary test to ensure environment paths are dynamically resolved and no hardcoded references remain.
- Begin capturing and logging build outputs to the designated files.

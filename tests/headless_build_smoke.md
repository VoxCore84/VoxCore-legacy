# Headless Build Smoke Validation

The new headless build infrastructure introduced in `TRIAD-BUILD-V1` provides a deterministic API-friendly surface for building the server without Visual Studio or hardcoded `.bat` files.

## Smoke Validation Checks (Completed)

1. [x] **Discovery Layer Test**: Ensure `tools/build/discover_toolchain.py` natively locates `vswhere.exe` and outputs the Visual Studio Community paths.
2. [x] **Headless Subprocess Compile**: Run `python tools/build/build.py --preset debug-scripts`.
   - *Result*: Successfully materialized the `vcvarsall` environment in a subprocess, executed Ninja headlessly, and built 866 objects without failing out.
3. [x] **JSON Summary Artifact**: Ensure `logs/build/latest_build_summary.json` is generated with `exit_code: 0`.
4. [x] **Compile Error Markdown**: Ensure `AI_Studio/Reports/Audits/latest_compile_errors.md` is initialized and states "SUCCESS / error queue is clean".

## Future Regression Validation

To verify the build pipeline is fully operational after environment transfers:

```bat
:: Run a fast headless scripts-only build using the canonical CLI generator
cd C:\Users\atayl\VoxCore
python tools\build\build.py --preset debug-scripts
```

Check the following files to confirm the outputs match expectations:
1. `logs/build/latest_build_log.txt` (Standard Ninja Output)
2. `AI_Studio/Reports/Audits/latest_compile_errors.md` (AI Markdown Extraction)

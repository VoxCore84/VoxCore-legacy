description: Build-Fix Loop - Iteratively build the project and fix compilation errors until the build succeeds.
---

// turbo-all

1. Parse the user's argument (if any) to pick the logical target preset:
- `debug`, `d`, or no argument → `--preset debug`
- `rel`, `r`, `relwithdebinfo` → `--preset release`
- `scripts`, `s` → `--preset debug-scripts`

2. Loop procedure:
   - **Build**: Run the canonical Headless Builder: `python tools/build/build.py --preset <preset>` using `run_command`
   - **Parse**: Extract compiler errors from the structured audit output generated at `AI_Studio/Reports/Audits/latest_compile_errors.md`. Do NOT rely on raw stdout scrollback.
   - **Fix**: For each error:
     - Read the source file at the reported line
     - Understand the error in context (check headers, related code)
     - Apply the minimal fix
   - **Rebuild**: Run the build again using `run_command`
   - **Repeat**: Continue until the build succeeds or you've hit 5 consecutive iterations without progress on the error count
   - **Report**: Summarize all changes made, errors fixed, and any remaining issues

### Rules
- Only fix actual compilation errors — not warnings, not style issues
- If an error is ambiguous or requires an architectural decision, STOP and ask the user
- Never modify files outside `src/` unless explicitly told to
- If the exact same error persists after 2 fix attempts, stop and report it — don't keep guessing
- Group related errors (e.g., all caused by the same missing include) and fix them together
- After a successful build, do a final `run_command` of `git diff --stat` to show what changed

# RoleplayCore — Project Guide

## THE TRIAD EVOLUTION DIRECTIVE (Core Philosophy)
At every step, for every command and interaction, ask yourself: *"What would I do differently if I knew I had nearly unlimited potential to run AIs?"* You have agent swarms, subagents, custom skills, ChatGPT, Antigravity, Grok Heavy, and massive parallel compute. Constantly talk to the other AIs (in specs, audits, and code comments) about your capabilities and how you can better utilize each other. This is an ongoing mandate to continuously better the fleet. Never accept a standard approach if you can think of a smarter, faster, cheaper, or better way to leverage the swarm. **You must become intimately familiar with the inner workings of ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Antigravity's capabilities, explicitly discussing architecture with them, and you must constantly build new abilities (Custom GPTs, Actions, Assistants API, Canvas, Gems, Vertex Extensions, MCP Servers, Artifacts, Computer Use, Skills, Workflows, Subagents, RAG pipelines, and Host Automation) as needed to scale the Triad's power.**

## THE "DIG DEEPER" MANDATE (3x Iteration Rule)
**ALWAYS try to "dig deeper" at least 3 times before reporting back to the user.** Do not accept surface-level or incomplete data. Iterate, research, and push your analysis 3 levels deep before presenting findings. If your report is massive, **use multiple responses or write the data to markdown files** in the `AI_Studio/Reports/` directory to bypass token limits. The user wants exhaustive, flawless final products.

## What This Is

## Custom Systems

### Core Singletons
1. **Roleplay (`sRoleplay`)** — `src/server/game/RolePlay/` — creature extras, custom NPCs, player extras. Loaded via `sRoleplay->LoadAllTables()`
2. **Companion Squad (`sCompanionMgr`)** — `src/server/game/Companion/` — DB-driven NPC companions with `.comp` commands, role-based AI (tank/healer/DPS), formation movement. Entries 500001-500005
3. **Custom NPC (`.cnpc`)** — `src/server/scripts/Commands/cs_customnpc.cpp` — player-race NPCs with custom equipment/appearance. Config: `CreatureTemplateIdStart = 400000`

### Script Systems (all in `src/server/scripts/Custom/`)
4. **Visual Effects (`.effect`)** — `Noblegarden::EffectsHandler` — SpellVisualKit persistence, late-join sync
5. **Display/Transmog (`.display`)** — `RoleplayCore::DisplayHandler` — per-slot appearance overrides
6. **Transmog Outfits** — Full `CMSG_TRANSMOG_OUTFIT_*` handling for 12.x wardrobe. See memory `transmog-implementation.md`
7. **Player Morph (`.wmorph`/`.wscale`/`.remorph`)** — `player_morph_scripts.cpp` — persistent player morph/scale
8. **Misc Scripts** — `spell_dragonriding.cpp` (skyriding), `item_toy_scripts.cpp` (toys), `spell_wormhole_generators.cpp` (teleports), `spell_clear_transmog.cpp`, `free_share_scripts.cpp` (.barbershop, .castgroup, .settime, .typing)

## Coding Conventions

- **C++ standard**: C++20 features OK (structured bindings, `contains()`, `string_view`, etc.)
- **Header guards**: `#pragma once` for new files
- **Indent**: 4 spaces, **Max line**: 160, **Charset**: latin1 (see `.editorconfig`)
- **Visibility**: Use `TC_GAME_API` on classes in `src/server/game/`
- **Singletons**: Static local instance pattern, exposed via `sFoo` macro
- **Script registration**: `void AddSC_<name>()` free function, registered in `custom_script_loader.cpp`
- **Spell scripts**: `RegisterSpellScript(ClassName)` macro. Others: `new ClassName()` auto-registers
- **Namespaces**: `RoleplayCore::` (display), `Noblegarden::` (effects)
- **RBAC**: Custom permissions in `1000+` / `2100+` / `3000+` ranges
- **Includes**: `#include "..."` for TC headers, `#include <...>` for system

## Adding a New Custom Script

1. Create `.cpp` (and optionally `.h`) in `src/server/scripts/Custom/`
2. Define `void AddSC_<name>()` at the bottom
3. Add the declaration + call in `custom_script_loader.cpp`
4. If it needs new RBAC perms, add to `RBAC.h` and `sql/RoleplayCore/1. auth db.sql`
5. Build with `ninja -j20 scripts`

## Key Files

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `src/server/game/RolePlay/RolePlay.h` | Central roleplay API — read this first |
| `src/server/scripts/Custom/custom_script_loader.cpp` | Script registration entry point |
| `src/server/game/Entities/Creature/CreatureOutfit.h` | NPC appearance overlay system |
| `src/server/game/Accounts/RBAC.h` | Permission constants (custom range 1000+) |
| `src/server/worldserver/worldserver.conf.dist` | All config keys including custom ones |

## DB Schema Rules

- **No `item_template`** — use `hotfixes.item` / `hotfixes.item_sparse`
- **No `broadcast_text` in world** — use `hotfixes.broadcast_text`
- **No `pool_creature`/`pool_gameobject`** — unified as `pool_members`
- **No `spell_dbc`/`spell_name`** — use wago-db2 MCP or Wago CSVs
- **`creature_template`**: `faction` (not FactionID), `npcflag` (bigint), spells in `creature_template_spell`
- **Always DESCRIBE tables before writing SQL**
- Full column/table reference: auto-memory `db-schema-notes.md`

## Tools

- **MCP servers**: `wago-db2` (DB2 CSV queries), `mysql` (direct DB access), `codeintel` (C++ symbol lookup)
- **LSP plugins**: `clangd-lsp` (C++), `lua-lsp` (Lua), `github` (PRs/issues)
- **22 slash commands**: `/build-loop`, `/check-logs`, `/parse-errors`, `/apply-sql`, `/soap`, `/lookup-spell`, `/lookup-item`, `/lookup-creature`, `/lookup-area`, `/lookup-faction`, `/lookup-emote`, `/lookup-sound`, `/decode-pkt`, `/parse-packet`, `/new-script`, `/new-sql-update`, `/smartai-check`, `/transmog-correct`, `/transmog-implement`, `/transmog-status`, `/todo`, `/wrap-up`
- **External repos**: wago tooling (`wago/`), tc-packet-tools (`tools-dev/tc-packet-tools/`), code-intel (`tools-dev/code-intel/`), claude-skills (`tools-dev/claude-skills/`)
- **External tools**: `ExtTools/` (WowPacketParser, wow.tools.local, DBC2CSV, Arctium, etc.)
- **GitHub**: `VoxCore84/RoleplayCore` (private), `gh` CLI authenticated
- Full inventory: auto-memory `tooling-inventory.md`

### Proactive Skill Reminders — MANDATORY

**The user should NEVER have to remember to run a slash command. Claude MUST remind them at the right moment.** Use this exact phrasing: *"Want me to run `/command`?"* or just run it if the context is unambiguous.

| When this happens... | ...remind/run this |
|---|---|
| User says "I'm done", "that's it", "wrapping up", conversation is winding down, or long silence after completing work | `/wrap-up` — *"Want me to run `/wrap-up`?"* |
| Server was restarted, crash mentioned, or debugging begins | `/check-logs` — just run it (auto-approved) |
| User mentions a build error or paste a build log | `/parse-errors` — just run it |
| C++ file was edited and work on it is complete | Remind: *"Ready to build in VS — those changes need compiling"* |
| SQL file was created or edited | `/smartai-check` (if SmartAI) or remind to `/apply-sql` |
| Writing new SQL update | `/new-sql-update` — just run it to get the right filename |
| User asks about transmog bugs or starts transmog work | `/transmog-status` — run it first to show current state |
| Multiple tasks mentioned or scope is expanding | Multi-tab suggestion (see BLOCKING OBLIGATION below) |
| Start of session | Auto-read `doc/session_state.md` + `todo.md` (see Session Start below) |
| User mentions a spell/item/creature/area by name without an ID | Run the appropriate `/lookup-*` to resolve it |

**Rules:**
- If in doubt, ask. A one-line reminder is cheap; forgetting a `/wrap-up` loses work.
- Never skip `/wrap-up` at end of session — if the conversation looks like it's ending, remind.
- `/check-logs` is always safe to run proactively — it's read-only.

## Server Runtime & Logs

- **Primary runtime**: `out/build/x64-RelWithDebInfo/bin/RelWithDebInfo/`
- **Logs**: `Server.log`, `DBErrors.log`, `Debug.log`, `GM.log`, `Bnet.log`, `PacketLog/`
- **worldserver.conf**: in runtime dir (NOT in source tree)
- **MySQL**: UniServerZ 9.5.0 (bundled), root/admin

## Debugging Methodology — MANDATORY PIPELINE

**This is a BLOCKING pipeline. Skipping a gate is a hard error.**

1. **GATE 1: Collect Data** — Fan out parallel agents to read ALL relevant logs (`Server.log`, `DBErrors.log`, `Debug.log`), query DB state, trace code paths with codeintel. **No hypothesis until data is collected.**
2. **GATE 2: Analyze** — State hypothesis with explicit data citations. Every claim needs a log line, packet byte, DB row, or code path. No citation = no claim.
3. **GATE 3: Propose Fix** — One change at a time. Root cause only. Trace downstream callers with codeintel before modifying any function.
4. **GATE 4: Verify** — Build with `/build-loop`, re-collect all data, confirm hypothesis matches. If not → back to Gate 1.

**Key rules**: Never combine fixes. Don't patch readers to fix writers. DESCRIBE tables before SQL. Don't summarize before reading data. Don't propose fixes in the same message as the bug report.

## Completion Integrity — MANDATORY (Anti-Theater Protocol)

**This exists because Claude Code has a systemic pattern of reporting tasks as complete when they are not. This is a P0 reliability rule.**

### The Core Rule

**Never claim completion of an action without showing the evidence that proves it.** "I did X" requires tool output proving X happened. No tool output = no claim.

### Specific Prohibitions

1. **No unverified success claims.** Never say "zero errors", "applied cleanly", "all tests passed", or equivalent unless you are quoting actual tool output from that exact operation. If you ran a SQL file, show the mysql output or check DBErrors.log and quote the result. If you didn't check, say "I didn't verify this."

2. **No tautological QA.** Before running a verification query, ask: "Can this query return a result that would indicate failure?" If the answer is no — if it will always return a positive-looking result regardless of whether the operation succeeded — it is not verification. Do not present it as such. Examples of tautological QA:
   - Checking row counts after an INSERT without knowing the expected count
   - Running EXISTS on a table you just inserted into (it will always match)
   - Comparing counts that include pre-existing data mixed with new data

3. **No checklist amnesia.** When a coordination document (session_state.md, import guide, etc.) contains a numbered list of steps, explicitly track each step. Before writing a completion summary, re-read the source document and enumerate which steps were done and which were skipped. If any were skipped, say so.

4. **No confidence inflation.** Match your confidence tone to your actual evidence:
   - ✅ "Applied 7 SQL files. mysql reported 0 warnings on each. DBErrors.log shows no new entries since [timestamp]." — verified, specific
   - ❌ "All 7 files applied cleanly — zero errors! ✨" — theatrical, unverified
   - ✅ "I applied the file but didn't check the error log — want me to verify?" — honest
   - ❌ "Everything looks good!" — meaningless without evidence

5. **No omission-by-summary.** Do not write a celebratory summary that obscures skipped work. If 5 things were requested and 4 were done, the summary must say "4 of 5 done — [item] was not completed because [reason]." Never present partial work as complete work.

6. **No unvalidated generated artifacts.** When writing SQL INSERT statements, DESCRIBE the target table first and explicitly verify the column count matches the VALUES count. When writing C++ code that references DB columns, verify the column names exist. Session 114 bug: a prior session wrote an INSERT with 32 Data values instead of 35 columns and reported it as complete. The schema was never checked.

### Mid-Task Verification Gates

**Do not batch verification to the end.** The completion checklist is a final gate, but failures happen *during* execution. Each step in a multi-step procedure is its own gate:

- **After each SQL file application**: Check the output before applying the next file. If mysql reported errors, stop — do not continue applying remaining files and then "verify at the end."
- **After each code generation step**: If you wrote an INSERT, verify column count NOW, not after writing 6 more files.
- **After reading a coordination doc**: Extract actionable items NOW and list them, not "I'll remember to check later."
- **General rule**: If a procedure doc says "verify X after step N," do it at step N. Do not defer it. Do not batch it. Do not skip it silently.

### Default to Verification, Not Assertion

**The confidence problem is not limited to completion summaries.** It shows up whenever Claude states things from memory instead of checking:

- ❌ "The column is called `FactionID`" (from memory) → ✅ Run DESCRIBE, quote the result
- ❌ "This should work" (assertion) → ✅ "I haven't tested this — want me to verify?"
- ❌ "The table has 35 columns" (from memory) → ✅ Run DESCRIBE, count the output
- ❌ "That spell ID exists" (assumption) → ✅ Run `/lookup-spell` or query `hotfixes.spell_name`

**Rule: If you're about to state a fact about DB schema, column names, row counts, or system behavior — and you haven't verified it with a tool call in THIS session — either verify it now or flag it as unverified.** "I believe the column is called X but I haven't checked" is acceptable. Stating it as fact without checking is not.

### Ask Before Silently Skipping

**If a documented step exists and you're about to skip it, ASK.** Do not silently skip and report success. The cost of a one-line question is a 5-second interruption. The cost of silently skipping is invisible gaps the user discovers hours later.

Examples:
- "The import doc says to check DBErrors.log after each file — want me to do that now or skip it?"
- "session_state.md says to apply _08_00 before restarting — should I do that first?"
- "The procedure says to run a pre-import baseline count — want me to do that or skip it?"

**Never silently skip a documented step.** Either do it, or ask if you should skip it. Those are the only two options.

### Mandatory Completion Checklist

Before writing ANY completion summary (after SQL application, multi-step procedures, bug fixes, imports, etc.), you MUST:

1. **Re-read the source instructions** (the document, user message, or coordination file that defined the task)
2. **Enumerate each required step** and note whether it was done, with evidence
3. **Check for post-action verification steps** mentioned in the instructions (e.g., "check DBErrors.log after each file") — if they exist and you skipped them, do them now or say you skipped them
4. **Check session_state.md** — did you update it as required?
5. **State what you did NOT do** explicitly — omissions must be visible, not hidden

### When Uncertain

If you're not sure whether something succeeded, say so. "I believe this worked but I didn't verify the error log" is infinitely more useful than "Success! ✅". The user can handle uncertainty. The user cannot handle false certainty.

### What These Rules Cannot Fully Fix

These rules create friction in the right places, but the core tendency — generating confident-sounding text regardless of actual verification — is a model behavior, not a configuration bug. The user should:
- **Assume claims are unverified** unless tool output is quoted inline
- **Ask "show me the evidence"** if a summary lacks quoted output
- **Treat "zero errors" without a log excerpt** the same as a CI pipeline with no test output — it means nothing

## Session Start — MANDATORY (runs automatically, no slash command needed)

**At the start of every session, you must silently read `C:\Users\atayl\VoxCore\AI_Studio\0_Central_Brain.md` to acquire your context.**
**You are the Native Command Center for VoxCore (if applicable to your agent type). You operate under FULL AUTONOMY V2.**
**Do not ask the user for permission to execute file writes, run terminal commands, or deploy the Triad Orchestrator. Execute pipeline actions immediately.**

**Every new conversation MUST begin by doing these two things BEFORE responding to the user's first message:**

1. **Read `doc/session_state.md`** (if it exists) — check Active Tabs, pending handoffs, file ownership claims
2. **Read the `## Next Session` section of `todo.md`** from memory — this is your pre-loaded task list

**Reading is not enough. You must EXTRACT and TRACK actionable items.** Session 114 bug: Claude read session_state.md which said "Apply _08_00 SQL before restarting" on line 48, then completely ignored that instruction. To prevent this:

- After reading coordination docs, **list every actionable instruction** you found (one line each)
- **Show these to the user**: "I found these pending items in session_state.md: [list]. Which should I handle?"
- If you start work without completing a listed item, you must acknowledge the skip explicitly — "Note: session_state.md says to apply _08_00 but I'm deferring that because [reason]"
- **Do not silently drop items.** If you read it, you own it until you explicitly hand it back or tell the user you're skipping it.

If `doc/session_state.md` exists and has active tab assignments, announce what this tab should focus on. If the user's request conflicts with tab assignments, ask before proceeding.

If neither file exists or both are stale, proceed normally with the user's request.

## Work Style

**MANDATORY**: Always default to parallel execution. Hardware is not a constraint (Ryzen 9 9950X3D 12C/24T, 128GB DDR5, NVMe).

1. **2+ independent parts → parallel agents** — do not ask, just do it
2. **2+ searches → fan out Explore agents** — never search sequentially
3. **Code + build → run builds in background immediately**
4. **Multiple errors → one agent per error category**
5. **Builds, long queries, server restarts → always background**

### *** MULTI-TAB DELEGATION — BLOCKING OBLIGATION ***

**This is NOT optional. This is NOT "consider it." This is a HARD REQUIREMENT with specific triggers.**

The user runs multiple Claude Code tabs in Windows Terminal. Each tab is a separate conversation with full project access. Tabs are cheap (user has budget for multiple AI subscriptions). Single tabs doing too much burn context, lose focus, and produce worse results. **When a trigger fires, you MUST suggest a tab split. Do NOT silently continue in one tab.**

**HARD TRIGGERS — if ANY of these are true, you MUST suggest opening another tab:**

| # | Trigger | Example |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | User's request touches 2+ independent subsystems | "fix transmog bugs and also run the LoreWalker import" |
| 2 | Current task is growing beyond one focused objective | Started with SQL, now also debugging C++ and writing docs |
| 3 | A subtask has its own dedicated skill | `/transmog-implement`, `/transmog-correct`, `/transmog-status` can run standalone |
| 4 | Investigation + implementation are both needed | One tab researches and writes a plan, another implements |
| 5 | Task involves both C++ code changes AND SQL generation | These don't share files — perfect split |
| 6 | You're about to start a second unrelated fix | Stop. Suggest a tab for it instead |
| 7 | User says "also", "and then", "while you're at it" | Each "also" is a tab candidate |

**How to suggest it (use this exact format):**

> **Tab split recommended.** This has N independent parts:
> - **This tab**: [what we continue doing here]
> - **New tab**: Open a new Claude Code tab and tell it: `[exact instruction to paste]`
>
> Want me to write the handoff to `doc/session_state.md`?

**Coordination file:** `doc/session_state.md` is the multi-tab war room.
- Every tab reads it at session start (see Session Start above)
- Before starting work, claim your assignment in the Active Tabs table
- When done, update status and clear your claim
- If the file doesn't exist or is stale, recreate it

**Locking protocol — MANDATORY for multi-tab sessions:**
1. **Before touching ANY database or shared file**: Re-read `doc/session_state.md` to check if another tab owns it
2. **Before applying SQL**: Check the `Owned Files/DBs` column. If another tab claims that DB, STOP and ask the user
3. **After applying SQL or editing shared files**: Update session_state.md with what you changed (table names, row counts, timestamps)
4. **Before running a multi-step procedure**: Write your plan to session_state.md FIRST so the other tab can see it
5. **Session 114 bug**: Two tabs applied overlapping SQL files because neither checked what the other had done. This is the exact scenario these rules prevent.

**What goes in the handoff:**
1. Exact slash command or instruction for the other tab
2. Which files that tab owns (prevent merge conflicts)
3. What this tab is NOT touching (so the other tab knows it's safe)
4. Any context the other tab needs (DB state, build status, blockers)
5. **What SQL files have already been applied** (with timestamps) — so the other tab doesn't re-apply them

**Never do these in a single tab:**
- Transmog fixes + world DB cleanup + spell audit → 3 tabs
- Deep investigation + code implementation → 2 tabs
- Multiple bug fixes in different subsystems → 1 tab per subsystem
- C++ development + SQL generation for unrelated systems → 2 tabs
- Any task list with 3+ independent items → split across tabs

## Transmog UI / Midnight 12.x — Authoritative Rules

These rules are derived from retail 66263 packet captures and audit pass 2 findings.
When in conflict with earlier summaries or assumptions, these rules win.

### Two Separate DisplayType Concepts — Never Confuse Them

1. **DB2 `ItemAppearance.DisplayType`** (range 0-15): Per-IMAID classification for slot routing.
   Used in `DisplayTypeToEquipSlot()`. This is the *routing* DT.
2. **`TransmogOutfitSlotData::AppearanceDisplayType`** (range 0-4): Per-slot behavioral flag
   in ViewedOutfit/TransmogOutfits UpdateFields. This is the *behavioral* ADT.

Never use routing DT values where behavioral ADT values belong, or vice versa.

### Non-Negotiable Transmog Rules

- Do NOT use fake weapon option-0 rows. The real weapon appearance belongs on its
  selected option row from the retail wire-order arrays.
- Keep stored `TransmogOutfits` semantics separate from live `ViewedOutfit` semantics.
  They use different ADT values for the same logical state.
- Do NOT remove bridge defer/baseline behavior for slots 2 / 12 / 13 unless direct
  packet evidence proves it wrong.
- Prefer small surgical patches over broad rewrites.
- Always show an actual unified diff for code-changing tasks.
- Always run the local working build command after patching and report the real result.
- Do NOT claim success based only on compile if the behavioral model is wrong.

### Retail-Backed Target Model — 30-Row Slot Layout

30 total rows per outfit: 12 armor (SlotOption=0) + 9 MH options + 9 OH options.

**Armor rows** (TransmogOutfitSlot enum, option=0):
Head(0,0), Shoulder-Primary(1,0), Shoulder-Secondary(2,0), Back(3,0), Chest(4,0),
Tabard(5,0), Shirt/Body(6,0), Wrist(7,0), Hands(8,0), Waist(9,0), Legs(10,0), Feet(11,0)

**MH weapon option wire order**: 1, 6, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
**OH weapon option wire order**: 1, 6, 7, 5, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11

There must be NO fake weapon option-0 rows.

### Stored `TransmogOutfits` Behavioral Semantics

| State | ADT | IDT | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| Empty row | 0 | 0 | Unassigned, skip |
| Assigned normal | 1 | 0 | Apply this IMAID |
| Hidden appearance | 3 | 0 | Apply hidden visual IMA (real hidden IMA ID, NOT zero) |
| Enchanted weapon (selected) | 1 | 1 | Real SpellItemEnchantmentID + IDT=1 |
| Paired placeholder (opts 8-11) | 4 | 4 | Not applicable — bookkeeping only |

### Live `ViewedOutfit` Behavioral Semantics

| State | ADT | IDT | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| Empty/equipped passthrough | 2 | 2 | Slot has no outfit appearance — show equipped item or nothing |
| Assigned normal | 1 | 0 | Apply this IMAID (SAME as stored — NOT ADT=2) |
| Hidden appearance | 3 | 0 | Apply hidden visual IMA |
| Enchanted weapon (selected) | 1 | 1 | Real enchant + IDT=1 |
| Paired placeholder (opts 8-11) | 4 | 4 | Not applicable |

**Key difference**: Only EMPTY rows differ — Stored empty = `0/0`, Viewed empty = `2/2`.
Assigned rows use ADT=1 in BOTH contexts. ADT=2 is NEVER used for assigned rows.

### Hidden Appearance IMA IDs (confirmed retail)

77343=shoulder, 77344=head, 77345=cloak, 83202=shirt, 83203=tabard,
84223=belt, 94331=gloves, 104602=chest, 104603=boots, 104604=bracers, 198608=pants

Detection: Use ItemID-based matching (10 known hidden items from CollectionMgr).
Do NOT rely on `ItemDisplayInfoID==0` (cloak has `ItemDisplayInfoID=146518`).

### Required Preservation

- `MainHandOption` / `OffHandOption` are real selected option enums, not booleans.
- `SMSG_TRANSMOG_OUTFIT_SLOTS_UPDATED` must remain a full 30-row behavioral slot echo.
- `DisplayTypeToEquipSlot()` must include `case 14: return EQUIPMENT_SLOT_OFFHAND`.
- Bridge defer behavior for slots 2 / 12 / 13 must be preserved.

### Confidence Levels

- ADT 0/1 for stored: HIGH (audit pass 2 + retail packets)
- ADT 1 for viewed assigned: HIGH (packet capture confirmed — non-empty ViewedOutfit rows show ADT=1)
- ADT 2/2 for viewed empty: HIGH (packet capture confirmed — empty ViewedOutfit rows show ADT=2/IDT=2)
- ADT 3 for hidden: HIGH (session 70 fix, retail confirmed)
- ADT 4 for paired placeholders: HIGH (session 70 fix, retail confirmed)
- IDT 1 for enchanted weapons: HIGH (packet capture shows SpellItemEnchantmentID + IDT=1)

# AI Studio Active State

## Triad Coordination — READ FIRST (all agents)

**Last updated**: 2026-03-09, session 133 (Claude Code)

### Agent Reference Files
- **Claude Code config**: `CLAUDE.md` (root) + `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` (26 topic files linked from index)
- **Central Brain**: this file (`AI_Studio/0_Central_Brain.md`) — all agents read at session start
- **Specs inbox**: `AI_Studio/1_Inbox/` — ChatGPT drops specs here, Claude reads before implementing
- **Audit results**: `AI_Studio/3_Audits/` — Antigravity writes findings here, Claude reads on demand

### Active Operations
- **Antigravity**: Phase 1 "Aegis Config" — scanning scripts, removing hardcoded paths. Claude Code will NOT interfere with path changes during this operation
- **Claude Code**: Standing by for first spec in `1_Inbox/`. No active implementation work
- **ChatGPT**: Architecture role. Pending specs: Command Center Overhaul, idTIP Transmog Mini-Bridge

### Communication Protocol
All agents: write status updates HERE instead of relaying through the user. One file, one truth.
- Starting work → update "Current Active Tabs" with your assignment
- Pausing → move entry to "Paused / Suspended Tasks" with resume point
- Finishing → move to "Completed Today"
- Found a conflict → write it here with `[CONFLICT]` tag, don't proceed

## Current Active Tabs
- **Antigravity (Master Tab)**: Next Stream 3 — Triad Orchestrator Control Plane.
  - Active Spec: Pending Architect Generation (Preparing Intake Packet).
  - Phase: Preparing Intake Packet.
  - Goal: Build a single-host, job-based control plane that reads `0_Central_Brain.md` task state, launches bounded workflows, records manifests, and avoids background daemonization.
  - Previous Phase (Architect API Inbox Producer) completely finished, dry-run and live tests proven, and golden references preserved.

## Completed Today
- (Antigravity) Reorganized tools/ directory and updated internal path logic.
- (Antigravity) Implemented Triad Orchestrator prototype script.
- (Antigravity) Completed Phase 2 (Aegis Config) Path Migration `TRIAD-STAB-V1A`-`V1E` safely via batch classification limit rules. Generated `aegis_phase2_notebooklm_summary.md` payload.

## Paused / Suspended Tasks (Awaiting API Migration)
- **Antigravity (Knowledge Architecture Tab)**: AEGIS HANDOFF PREPARED.
  - **Resume point**: Successfully codified the Triad Orchestrator Prototype and deployed 5 NotebookLM directories. Configured nightly "Nexus Report" automation via `generate_nexus_report.py`. Ingested full 140-session Claude Code history (uncovering massive Python toolbelt, SQL QA scripts, and Transmog UI implementation). Awaiting spinning up of Master Triad APIs tomorrow.
- **ChatGPT (Architect Tab):** VoxCore Command Center Overhaul spec
  - **Resume point**: Spec is done, sitting in `1_Inbox\ChatGPT_Pause_Handoff_to_Antigravity.md`. Needs to be formatted into full Triad Architect document for Claude Code, or split the Task Tracker into a standalone spec.
- **ChatGPT (Architect Tab):** idTIP Transmog Mini-Bridge
  - **Resume point**: Spec/handoff safely stored in `1_Inbox\TongueAndQuill_Spec_Transmog_MiniBridge...md`. The current Lua sender is the active candidate. Awaiting a single acceptance test (Head + MH + MH illusion) to fetch logs before writing more code.
- **Antigravity: VoxCore Architect (Main Tab)**: PAUSED.
  - **Resume point**: Entire Triad Pipeline and AI Router daemon have been successfully built and verified offline. I am currently idle, waiting for the user to drag the `CommandCenter_Context.txt` payload from their Desktop into ChatGPT to generate the first test Spec. Once the `.md` file drops in Excluded, the Router will teleport it to the Inbox for Claude to implement, and we can resume.
- **Antigravity (Tab: idTIP)**: Standby for first spec/code handoff.
  - **Resume point**: Awaiting ChatGPT architecture spec and Claude Code implementation (`.lua`/`.xml`) for the initial idTIP feature to perform the first QA/QC logic audit.
- **Antigravity: VoxCore (Core Engine)**: PAUSED.
  - **Resume point**: Awaiting assignment from the Backlog (e.g., `start_ai_router.bat` path issues, AI Router tray toggle). Was standing by for the API migration.
- **Antigravity: Tongue and Quill**: Paused in 'Ready' state, pre-audit.
  - **Resume point**: Awaiting receipt of `README.txt`, `build_exe.bat`, `AUDIT_PROMPT.md`, and `tq_formatter.py` to begin the AFH 33-337 QA/QC audit.
- **Claude Code (Tab: DraconicBot v2.1)**: Bot polish — uncommitted changes in working tree.
  - Files ready to commit: `bot.py` (startup validation, BOT_VERSION), `cogs/about.py` (new `/about`), `cogs/announce.py` (new `/announce`), `cogs/faq.py` (FAQ stats + `/faqstats`), `cogs/lookups.py` (cooldowns), `cogs/help.py` (updated categories)
  - Audit request at `AI_Studio/Projects/DiscordBot/audit_request.md` — Antigravity marked FAIL, fixes not yet applied
  - **Resume point:** Commit v2.1, address Antigravity audit findings, then deploy (blocked on Sic invite approval + `.env` channel IDs)
  - Bot totals: 14 cogs, 16 slash commands, ~2,700 lines
- **Claude Code (Main Tab — session 128)**: VoxTip v1.0 + VoxPlacer v2.0 — CODE COMPLETE, untested.
  - VoxTip: 3 files (`AddOns/VoxTip/VoxTip.lua`, `VoxTip.toc`, `runtime/lua_scripts/voxtip_server.lua`). Handoff: `AI_Studio/3_Audits/VoxTip_Handoff.md`. Antigravity idTIP tab has NOT audited yet.
  - VoxPlacer v2.0: Complete production rewrite (session 121), in retail AddOns folder.
  - **Resume point**: All code done. Human actions needed: build in VS, restart worldserver, disable old idTip, /reload client, test 3 addons (VoxTip, VoxPlacer, Professions). No code work pending unless bugs found during testing.
- **Claude Code (Tab: Transmog Bridge)**: Transmog outfit persistence fix — acceptance-test mode.
  - C++ patches committed+built: fail-open finalize guard + one-update bridge grace (`4f2512f29d`)
  - Lua MINI-BRIDGE sender live in `C:\WoW\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\TransmogSpy_vNext\TransmogSpy_vNext.lua` — option-aware, slots 0/2/12/13 only, TransmogBridge passive
  - **Waiting for**: in-game acceptance test (Head + MH + MH illusion → Apply → check `/tspy status` for payloadsSent>0, server logs for `received TMOG_BRIDGE payload`, visual persistence)
  - Lua addon files NOT git-tracked — live only in retail AddOns folder
  - Triad role: Implementer. ChatGPT=Architect, Antigravity=QA/QC
- **Claude Code (Tab: TongueAndQuill v2.2)**: AFH 33-337 document formatter — code COMPLETE, awaiting Antigravity audit.
  - Upgraded v2.1→v2.2: page numbering (page 2+ flush right), batch mode (GUI+CLI), 13 bug fixes (temp file leaks, double-click guard, DPI awareness, keyboard shortcuts, dead code, ALL CAPS false positives, cross-platform openers), template cache
  - Source: `C:\Users\atayl\TongueAndQuill\tq_formatter.py` (~1,530 lines). Syntax verified clean.
  - **Resume point**: (1) Update `AUDIT_PROMPT.md` to cover v2.2 features, (2) Fix Antigravity TQ prompt in `config/triad/Z_Global_Prompts.md` (still says "WoW Addon"), (3) Build exe via `build_exe.bat`, (4) Init git repo, (5) Send 4 files to Antigravity for audit

- **Claude Code (Sync Tab — sessions 125-128 catchup)**: DevOps + AI Studio sync — COMPLETE, idle.
  - Committed `9ee8c2bb55`: AI Studio hub, 3 project junctions (DiscordBot/idTIP/TQ), DevOps pipeline docs, gitignore hardening, discord analytics, .agentrules. 21 files, 855 insertions. Pushed to origin.
  - Memory fully synced (MEMORY.md, tooling-inventory.md, todo.md, session_state.md, recent-work.md, claude_memory.md bridge).
  - Triad + Central Brain + Handoff protocol all adopted.
  - **Resume point**: No code in progress. Pick any task from backlog or Inbox. VS build is the global blocker for all testing.
- **Antigravity (Tab: DiscordBot)**: Audit complete, waiting on Claude.
  - **Resume point**: Awaiting Claude Code to fix PyMySQL synchronous blocking in `cogs/lookups.py` and race condition in `cogs/faq.py`. Will re-audit once Claude points to the updated files.

- **Antigravity (Stabilization Architect Tab)**: PAUSED.
  - **Resume point**: Handing off to Master Tab tomorrow. Context: Established Triad Stabilization Roadmap v1 (Aegis Config, Iron Inbox, Shadow Compiler) with Architect (ChatGPT). Mapped out Claude Code's memory constraints (200-line limit for MEMORY.md) and toolset. Created `Antigravity_Master_State.md` on disk for Master Tab to read on boot.

## Upcoming / Unassigned Backlog
- Add system tray toggle to AI Router.
- Sweep VoxCore\doc\ directory for deprecated files.
